### Continuous Cloth Roll Towels

Did you know that **Continuous Cloth Roll Towel Systems (CRT)** are more hygienic than Disposable Roll Towel Systems (DRT) or air dryers? Research and clinical testing have shown that cloth roll towels rank #1 in hygiene for hand washing in restrooms. 

While high-speed air dryers are often marketed as environmentally friendly, they do not compare to the hygiene standards of Continuous Cloth Roll Towels. Our Continuous Cloth Roll Towels are dispensed from towel cabinet dispensers and are available in two options:

- **90% Cotton and 10% Polyester**
- **100% Cotton**

Choose **Angelica Uniforms** for a linen service that meets your needs for quality, performance, and hygiene.
